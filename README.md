Simple blog design.

**Idea**  
A simple and elegant design for a blog. Focused on readability and typography with big images. The idea is more that users come here to read rather than building a website with this.

That is why we discourage pagination opting for a simple "more posts". The reader should not care for pages if they want to get an overview they can use the archive. Which also isn't a widget or anything but a link at the bottom. Nothing should distract you from reading.

Todo:

- [x] header
- [x] headlines
- [x] general layout
- [x] nice underline
- [x] images
- [x] lists
- [x] quotes
- [x] tables
- [ ] code blocks
